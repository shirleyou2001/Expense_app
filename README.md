Build a monthly expense tracker with yearly reporting and comparison features. It was built by using React with TypeScript and create a clean, user-friendly interface.

I've created a comprehensive expense tracking application with the following features:

1. **Monthly Expense Management:**
    - Add new expenses with categories and amounts
    - Edit existing expense amounts
    - Delete expenses
    - View monthly totals
    - Pre-populated with default expenses for each month

    Yearly Report:
2. **Total yearly expenses**
    - Monthly breakdown with visual bars
    - Category totals
    - Real-time updates as you modify expenses
    - User Interface:
    - Clean and modern design
    - Responsive layout
    - Visual feedback for expense distribution
    - Easy-to-use forms and controls

3. **Features:**
    - Sticky yearly report that stays visible while scrolling through months
    - Visual charts for monthly comparisons
    - Category-wise breakdown
    - Edit and delete functionality for each expense
    - Pre-populated with common expense categories

4. **You can now:**
    - View and modify expenses for each month
    - Add new expenses using the form
    - Edit existing expenses by clicking the edit icon
    - Delete expenses using the trash icon
    - See the yearly report update in real-time as you make changes
